## Setup

### Python Projects

To run the Python projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leonela27/data-analysis-portfolio.git
   cd data-analysis-portfolio
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Linux/macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Execution

### Python Projects

1. Navigate to the project directory and run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    cd projects/python-projects/project1
    jupyter notebook
    ```

### PowerBI Projects

To explore and interact with the Power BI projects:

1. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.

2. Explore the report and interact with the visualizations. You can slice and filter the data directly within Power BI Desktop to gain insights.
