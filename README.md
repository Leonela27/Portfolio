# Data Analysis Portfolio üìä

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that I am currently completing as part of my ongoing [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) bootcamp. The portfolio features real-world projects in Python, which are designed around practical scenarios provided by the DataCamp platform. These projects highlight my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

In addition to the DataCamp projects, the portfolio includes Power BI projects that I developed during an intensive program with [4Go Academy](https://4goacademy.com/). These projects focus on creating interactive dashboards and insightful reports, demonstrating my capabilities in Business Intelligence and data visualization.

Explore the projects to see how I've applied my data analysis skills in different contexts and settings.

## About Me üë©‚Äçüíª

I am currently completing my degree in Computer Engineering, with all coursework finished and focusing on my capstone project in machine learning and data analysis. My professional experience spans various sectors, including electronic invoicing and the video industry, covering all stages of the software development lifecycle from analysis and design to maintenance and customer support.

I have worked with .NET, Python, Node.js, and TypeScript. My background includes extensive work in teams utilizing agile methodologies, with a strong analytical profile focused on detailed documentation and continuous improvement. My academic background also includes coursework in project management. 

I am nearing the completion of a Data Analysis bootcamp at DataCamp, which has further developed my skills in Python, data management, and statistical analysis. I am currently seeking my first opportunity in a Business Analyst or Data Analyst role to apply and expand my expertise in these areas.


## Projects üìÇ

This portfolio includes various data analysis projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in both Python and Power BI.
This portfolio features data analysis projects that I am currently working on and adding as I progress through my ongoing bootcamp. It showcases my evolving skills and knowledge in both Python and Power BI.

- **Python Projects**: These projects are located in the [`python-projects`](./projects/python-projects/) directory. Each project includes a detailed description of the problem tackled, the methodologies used, and the results achieved. For more information, refer to the corresponding [README](./projects/python-projects/README.md) file.

- **Power BI Projects**: These projects are found in the [`powerbi-projects`](./projects/powerbi-projects/) directory. They include interactive dashboards and reports created to provide valuable insights. For more information, refer to the corresponding [README](./projects/powerbi-projects/README.md) file.


## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
