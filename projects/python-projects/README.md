## Python Projects üêç

Below is a selection of my data analysis projects:

1. **Project 1: Netflix Movies Analysis**
   - **Description:** This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Netflix dataset, focusing on movies released in the 1990s. The analysis includes identifying trends in movie durations, determining the frequency of short action movies, and visualizing the distribution of different show types. The project aims to derive insights into the characteristics of 1990s movies on Netflix..
   - **Skills Used:** Data cleaning, Python, Pandas, Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, max, min).

**Project 2: LA Crimes Analysis**
   - **Description:** This project involves a comprehensive analysis of crime data in Los Angeles, focusing on various aspects such as crime trends over time, geographical distribution, ethnic background of victims, crime types by area, and more. The analysis includes handling missing values, standardizing categorical variables, managing outliers, and applying stratified sampling. Insights include identifying the most common crimes, the most dangerous areas, the most frequently used weapons, and patterns in crime frequency based on age and time of day.
   - **Skills Used:** Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Stratified Sampling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Descriptive Statistics.
