This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that I am currently completing as part of my ongoing [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) bootcamp. The portfolio features real-world projects in Python, which are designed around practical scenarios provided by the DataCamp platform. These projects highlight my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. In addition to the DataCamp projects, the portfolio includes Power BI projects that I developed during an intensive program with [4Go Academy](https://4goacademy.com/). These projects focus on creating interactive dashboards and insightful reports, demonstrating my capabilities in business intelligence and data visualization. Explore the projects to see how I've applied my data analysis skills in different contexts and settings. ## Table of Contents 📑 - [About Me](#about-me) - [Python Projects](#python-projects) - [PowerBI Projects](#powerbi-projects) - [Setup](#setup) - [Execution](#execution) ## About Me 👩‍💻 I am currently completing my degree in Computer Engineering, with all coursework finished and focusing on my capstone project in machine learning and data analysis. My professional experience spans various sectors, including electronic invoicing and the video industry, covering all stages of the software development lifecycle from analysis and design to maintenance and customer support. I have worked with .NET, Python, Node.js, and TypeScript. My strengths include strong analytical skills, meticulous documentation, and effective teamwork. My academic background also includes coursework in project management. I am nearing the completion of a Data Analysis bootcamp at DataCamp, which has further developed my skills in Python, data management, and statistical analysis. I am currently seeking my first opportunity in a Business Analyst or Data Analyst role to apply and expand my expertise in these areas. ## Python Projects 🐍 Below is a selection of my data analysis projects: Skills Used: 1. **Project 1: Netflix Movies Analysis** - **Description:** This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Netflix dataset, focusing on movies released in the 1990s. The analysis includes identifying trends in movie durations, determining the frequency of short action movies, and visualizing the distribution of different show types. The project aims to derive insights into the characteristics of 1990s movies on Netflix.. - **Skills Used:** Data cleaning, Python, Pandas, Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, max, min). - **Link:** [Project Folder](./projects//python-projects/project1) 2. **Project 2: [Project Title]** - **Description:** Brief overview of the project. - **Skills Used:** Data visualization, Python, Matplotlib, etc. - **Link:** [Project Folder](./projects/python-projects/project2) 3. **Project 3: [Project Title]** - **Description:** Brief overview of the project. - **Skills Used:** Statistical analysis, Python, Scipy, etc. - **Link:** [Project Folder](./projects/python-projects/project3) ## PowerBI Projects 💹 1. **Project 1: Financial Dashboard** - **Description:** A dashboard showcasing sales performance across different product categories, classes, and time periods, with interactive visuals such as grouped bar and column charts, line graphs, stacked columns, and key metrics cards. - **Skills Used:** Data Modeling, DAX, Data Visualization, Power Query, Calendar Table Creation, Custom Themes, Filtering, Tooltip. - **Link:** [Financial Dashboard](./projects/powerbi-projects/project1) 2. **Project 2: HR Analytics Dashboard** - **Description:** A dashboard that analyzes employee metrics such as total hires, active headcount, turnover rate, and demographic distribution, broken down by job role, using various visualizations including area, funnel, and ring charts. - **Skills Used:** Data visualization, DAX, Power Query. - **Link:** [HR Analytics Dashboard](./projects/powerbi-projects/project2) 3. **Project 3: Sales Dashboard** - **Description:** A dashboard that provides key insights into sales performance, including total sales, costs, profit, and sales trends by year and month.
